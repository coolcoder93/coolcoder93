- I'm currently working on an open source 3D game engine called "Flint And Stone Engine" written in C++ and using vulkan (it's in quite early development)
- I'm currently learning C/C++ and Rust
- I'm interested in: 
  - Math
  - Computer science
  - Low-level programming
  - Art
  - Music
- My favorite language is Rust but I also really like C/C++
- My dream is to make my own game using my own game engine
